# A helper to end a conversation

## How it works
### Calls
Ever tried to end a conversation but found no excuse to go? This simple application will help you with that. When in conversations, you press the button on this app, and someone will call you right after and play whatever recording or words you configured it to play. (something like "Hey Marty, your roof is on fire! Come now!")
Then you can safely excuse yourself.
You can even customize the content you want to hear from the other end. Put in the words you'd like to hear and press "CustomCall".

### Messages
A message will be sent to your phone after you press the button. Customization is also allowed.

### How to access the app
For developers, you can apply a Twilio trial account, put in the Twilio credentials and host it on cloud.
For non-developers, visit http://callcall.azurewebsites.net/. Anything you put in would only be directed to my phone for now (not very exciting, really). But you can definitely text me using "CustomMsg" anytime, anywhere! (and help me end those nightmare conversations)

## Twilio (to call and message)
The app is powered by Twilio API.
For this prototype, only verified Twilio numbers can be called or texted. A standard Twilio account will make this app more practical.
